						<h2>Unit 1 Notes:</h2>
						<p>Outcomes: <br>
							1)Appreciate the value of data visualisation. <br>
							2)Appreciate the basic principles of data visualisation.<br>
							3)Know about different tools and techniques used for data visualisation.
						 </p>
						 <p>
      						  The lecture cast Principles of Data Visualisation was insightful. I completed the formative activity as well as the case study which was posted on the Module Wiki. This tapped into communication with peers on the Wiki as well as easing into data visualisations and the integral role it can play.  
        						<a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/glossary/view.php?g=3904">View more details</a>.
						 </p>	
					</div>
					<div class="unit-notes" id="unit-2-notes">
						<h2>Unit 2 Notes:</h2>
						<p>Outcomes: <br>
							1)Critically evaluate different data visualisation principles used.<br>
							2)Identify and apply data visualisation grammar more effectively.
						</p>
						<p>
						 The lecture cast Principles of Data Visualisation 2 was also helpful in better understanding concepts. The formative activity for this week was a collaborative discussion on the Report on Ryanair and Easyjet Websites. My response can be found here: 
							<a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=246839">here</a>. <br>
						Referencing and actively engaging with both websites and the various functions, strengths, weaknesses, visible features etc. were exercised during this activity. 
							
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="unit-notes" id="unit-3-notes">
						<h2>Unit 3 Notes:</h2>
						<p>Outcomes: <br>
							1)Write and execute basic R script through Codio IDE.<br>
							2)Understanding of dataframe and basic visualisation techniques.<br>
							3)Understanding of libraries and basic functions.
						</p>
						<p>
						In this unit, I started exploring Rstudio. The challenge was installing it and getting comfortable with the functionality and layout. I did the recommended reading for this module and the exercises from the textbook, which helped ease the nerves. I did not partake in the peer response requirement
							for this module on the previous formative activity. None of my peers had commenced or initiated this exercise. Reflecting on this, I could have shown leadership and completed this exercise irrespective in anyone else did. 
					</div>
					<div class="unit-notes" id="unit-4-notes">
						<h2>Unit 4 Notes:</h2>
						<p>Outcomes: <br>
							1)Read data from different sources.<br>
							2)Organise the data according to the need for future analysis.
						</p>
						<p>
						This unit focused on Reading, Organising and Writing Data with R. I worked through the readings and textbook exercises covering this topic
							allowing me a better understanding for assignment ahead. 
					</div>
					<div class="unit-notes" id="unit-5-notes">
						<h2>Unit 5 Notes:</h2>
						<p>Outcomes: <br>
							Understand and appreciate the process of data transformation.<br>
							Understand and appreciate the process of EDA.<br>
							Get more familiar with the R programming language.
						</p>
						<p>
						This unit involved a formative activity using python. As I was working towards completing my assignment in R, I opted to work through the similar
							topics in the prescribed textbook instead. 
					</div>
					<div class="unit-notes" id="unit-6-notes">
						<h2>Unit 6 Notes:</h2>
						<p>Outcomes: <br>
							Apply logistic regression as classifier and visualise the classes.<br>
							Apply some trees-based methods to visualise and interpret how the trees make their decisions.<br>
							Use ROC curve to measure and visualise the performance of your model.
						</p>
						<p>
						This unit covered models which was discussed during the seminar as well. I felt slightly challenged trying to understand the requirements
							and the processes to follow as well as carrying it out in R. With the discussion in the seminar, the lecture cast, research and working through the recommended reading,
							I was able to tackle exercises as well as work through this section of the assignment. 
					</div>
					<div class="unit-notes" id="unit-7-notes">
						<h2>Unit 7 Notes:</h2>
						<p>Outcomes: <br>
							1)Use PCA and visualise and interpret your findings. <br>
							2)Use K-means and Hierarchical clustering methods to visualise and understand your clusters.
						</p>
						<p>
						I completed the lecture cast and focus was on working through the assignment. Discussion during the seminars as well as reaching out 
							directly to the tutor was beneficial in order to clarify parts I was not sure about and guide me on the right path.
					</div>
					<div class="unit-notes" id="unit-8-notes">
						<h2>Unit 8 Notes:</h2>
						<p>Outcomes: <br>
							1)Select the right data visualisation approach for machine learning related tasks.<br>
							2)Select appropriate python libraries for a given data visualisation task.<br>
							3)Appreciate the value of EDA in context understanding the data structure.
						</p>
						<p>
						This unit was the deadline for the Programming assignment. This was completed and submitted on time. The focus was on ensuring all parts of the assignment
							was included and insights were provided. A significant challenge I faced was adhering to the word count and this allowed me to practice succinct and concise writing. 
					</div>
					<div class="unit-notes" id="unit-9-notes">
						<h2>Unit 9 Notes:</h2>
						<p>Outcomes: <br>
							1)Identify the business need and type of dashboard required.<br>
							2)Understand how to design a dashboard.
						</p>
						<p>
						This unit shifted focus to dashboard designing. The lecture cast provided insight and direction on aspects to consider when
							designing a dashboard. This unit also entailed the submission of the dashboard draft. I ensured to submit in order to obtain 
							feedback and ensure I am on the right track straight from the start. 
					</div>
					<div class="unit-notes" id="unit-10-notes">
						<h2>Unit 10 Notes:</h2>
						<p>Outcomes: <br>
							1)Use Tableau for basic visual display and analytic purposes.<br>
							2)Use basic visual analytics for business intelligence.
						</p>
						<p>
						As I had decided to build my dashboard in Power BI, the tableau was informative but not entirely relevant to my dashboard assignment. 
							I worked on the dashboard assignment, building and analysing and researching to ensure all the required functions are included.
							The visuals of the dashboard required intentional decisions thus requiring some research.
					</div>
					<div class="unit-notes" id="unit-11-notes">
						<h2>Unit 11 Notes:</h2>
						<p>Outcomes: <br>
							1)Create your own dashboard with Tableau.<br>
							2)Customise a dashboard according to users' specifications.
						</p>
						<p>
						This week focused on learning various functions in Power BI and progressing with the assignment. It was helpful attending the seminar
							and collaborating and discussing as many of us were facing similar challenges. The seminar also touched on the ePortfolio and the
							reflection assignment. 
					</div>
					<div class="unit-notes" id="unit-12-notes">
						<h2>Unit 12 Notes:</h2>
						<p>Outcomes: <br>
							1)Augment your visualisation literacy.<br>
							2)Design and develop data visualisation projects following good practice.
						</p>
						<p>
						The end of this unit required the submission of both the dashboard and reflection assignments. Each assignment had it's own challenges
							and time management played a big role in ensuring progress was made on both to submit on time. Feedback from the tutor on the reflection
							the piece was significantly useful and provided an alternative perspective which challenged my view and allowed me the opportunity to critical think
							and decide on a way forward.
