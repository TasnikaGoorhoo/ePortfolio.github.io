									Introduction<br>
										Data visualisation has been more about communicating information to tell a story or provide insights for decision-making. 
										This has been my experience. This module aimed to quip students with a deep understanding of data visualization, 
										essential for analyzing extensive datasets to enhance business decision-making, by exploring core concepts and techniques 
										while gaining proficiency in tools like R and Power BI, ultimately enabling them to assess visualization methods, 
										apply appropriate tools for diverse datasets, and effectively communicate complex information to stakeholders 
										(University of Essex, 2024). Data visualisation can be a powerful method to work with data to gain and convey insights 
										for business and client value; this has been a personal motivation as someone working in technical research and analysis. 
										With this individual reflection piece, I will make use of the Rolfe et al. model to convey my experiences and 
										journey through this module, explore my learnings and growth and contemplate future opportunities from these insights 
										(University of Wollongong Australia, 2023). Through this reflection, my goal is to encapsulate my journey through the model, 
										highlight challenges, growth and skills obtained and lastly how I will apply these insights.

									Description <br>
										The data visualisation module aims to equip students with the skills to evaluate and apply data visualization principles, assess different tools and programming languages for extracting insights, implement key techniques using realistic datasets, and choose the most suitable tools for effectively communicating complex information to support informed decision-making (University of Essex, 2024). 
										The first big assignment involved working with a large dataset in R and producing a succinct report. This exercise provided practical exposure to a new language, understanding and applying fundamental rules and concepts of data visualization in creating and presenting visuals as well as the application of statistical analysis. The second big assignment entailed designing and developing a dashboard, allowing me to explore design principles, key analysis and visualization techniques using realistic data and selecting the best visualisations to present complex information for informed decision-making. 
										The module provided opportunities to learn and develop skills in R and Power BI. 
										Here was I able to develop techniques such as cleaning data, how to choose the right visualisation, 
										design principles, statistical analysis and application and storytelling with data in various formats. 
										By attending the module seminars I was able to engage with fellow students, collaborate and discuss the 
										work and obtain invaluable feedback. The Module Wiki allowed for further collaboration where I was able to 
										share information I found useful in my learning journey with my classmates.

									Analysis and Interpretation <br>
									Initially, I felt overwhelmed, nervous and apprehensive about the data visualisation journey however as 
									I worked through each unit, completed the suggested readings and formative activities as well as extra learning 
									through videos and collaboration my confidence and curiosity grew. The extra learning was undertaken as data 
									visualisation can be viewed through various lenses (Telea, 2015). Collaborative learning aids in greater productivity 
									and self-esteem and played a large role in my development (Laal & Ghodsi, 2012). Completing the module exercises and 
									the assignments, my confidence increased, particularly with the application of the tools and analysis of the problems. 
									One major challenge I faced was understanding and using R which caused me some anxiety and frustration in completing 
									the assignment. Undertaking the book exercises and actively attending the seminars lead to a better understanding and 
									deeper ability to complete the assignment (Miller, 2021). I found feedback useful during the seminars and email 
									communication with my professor. I was able to gain an improved understanding of statistical modelling which prompted 
									me in the right direction and to further explore the performance of the models leaving me feeling curious and engaged. 
									Here my critical thinking and analysis as well as digital skills were enhanced. Additionally, I learned various 
									visualization skills including design principles as outlined by Martins, et al., (2022). Communication and succinct 
									report writing are other valuable skills I will apply in future projects as mentioned by Sparks, et al., (2014). 
								
									</p>
									<p>
									Future Application <br>
									Moving forward, I plan to use my skills in R to perform statistical analysis within my current job to explore and 
										create models as well as build a dashboard for my team to aid in daily operations. These goals will aid in 
										further developing my data visualisation skills with more advanced analysis and improve the skills Iâ€™ve gained 
										through this module. I will continue with other modules in the Data Science course to further build my knowledge. 
										Therefore in the short-term, my goal is to carry out one R-based project and medium-term to build a dashboard for 
										my team. Longer-term, I would like to use my data visualisation skills within the wider business to create visuals 
										for client presentations. Using the feedback I have received through this module, I will ensure the right visuals 
										are presented for business decisions and audience-appropriate. I will also present work in a clearly communicative 
										and succinct manner as emphasized through the assignments undertaken. Making use of my GitHub portfolio, I will 
										document my experiences and practical skills which will allow me to identify areas of growth and showcase my 
										development. 

										</p>
										<p>
										Conclusion <br>
										This module allowed me to gain fundamental and essential skills in data visualization with the use of tools like R 
										and Power BI. My ability to work with large amounts of data and present insights effectively has improved. 
										Beyond technical skills, I have enhanced my critical thinking, problem-solving and communication skills enabling me to
										present more confidently. This journey will continue as I use these skills within my career in the energy industry. 
										Data is everywhere and essential to progress and decision-making, data visualization makes this possible.
